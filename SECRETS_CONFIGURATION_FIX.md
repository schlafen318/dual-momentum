# Secrets Configuration Fix for Backtesting

## Problem Resolved

**Error Message:**
```
Backtest failed: No secrets found. Valid paths for a secrets.toml file or secret directories are: 
/root/.streamlit/secrets.toml, /app/.streamlit/secrets.toml, /app/dual_momentum_system/frontend/.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

## Root Cause

The application was trying to access Streamlit secrets for optional API keys (AlphaVantage, TwelveData), but:
1. The secrets.toml file was empty
2. The code wasn't handling the case where secrets might not exist gracefully
3. Streamlit throws an error when trying to access secrets if the file doesn't exist or is empty

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Secrets Configuration File

**Location:** `/workspace/dual_momentum_system/.streamlit/secrets.toml`

**Contents:** Documented configuration file with:
- Clear explanation that API keys are **optional**
- Instructions for getting free API keys (if desired)
- Deployment notes for cloud environments
- Commented-out key placeholders

### 2. Updated Code for Graceful Handling

**File:** `dual_momentum_system/frontend/pages/strategy_builder.py`

**Changes:**
- Added try-except block around secrets access
- Catches `FileNotFoundError` and `RuntimeError` 
- Falls back to environment variables or Yahoo Finance only
- No errors shown to users when secrets are missing

**Before:**
```python
api_config = {}
if hasattr(st, 'secrets'):
    if 'ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY' in st.secrets:
        api_config['alphavantage_api_key'] = st.secrets['ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY']
```

**After:**
```python
api_config = {}
try:
    if hasattr(st, 'secrets') and st.secrets:
        if 'ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY' in st.secrets:
            api_config['alphavantage_api_key'] = st.secrets['ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY']
except (FileNotFoundError, RuntimeError):
    # Secrets file not found or empty - this is fine
    pass
```

### 3. Verified Solution

✅ Core components work without secrets:
- Data source initialization
- Strategy creation
- Backtest engine initialization
- Actual backtest execution

✅ Backtest runs successfully with real data from Yahoo Finance

## How It Works Now

### Default Behavior (No API Keys)
1. System uses **Yahoo Finance** as the only data source
2. No errors or warnings about missing secrets
3. Backtests work perfectly for all operations
4. **This is the recommended setup for most users**

### With API Keys (Optional Enhanced Reliability)
1. System uses Yahoo Finance as primary source
2. Falls back to AlphaVantage or TwelveData if Yahoo fails
3. Provides automatic failover for maximum reliability
4. **Recommended for production deployments**

## Deployment Guide

### Local Development

The secrets.toml file is already configured. No action needed!

### Cloud Deployment (Railway, Streamlit Cloud, etc.)

**Recommended:** Use environment variables instead of secrets.toml

```bash
# Set in your cloud platform's environment configuration
ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Optional
TWELVEDATA_API_KEY=your_key_here    # Optional
```

### Railway Specific

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Navigate to Variables tab
3. Add (optional):
   - `ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY` = your_key_here
   - `TWELVEDATA_API_KEY` = your_key_here

### Streamlit Cloud Specific

In Streamlit Cloud:
1. Go to App Settings → Secrets
2. Add (optional):
```toml
ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
TWELVEDATA_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
```

## Getting Free API Keys (Optional)

### Alpha Vantage
- **URL:** https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
- **Free Tier:** 500 requests/day, 5 requests/minute
- **No credit card required**

### Twelve Data
- **URL:** https://twelvedata.com/pricing
- **Free Tier:** 800 requests/day, 8 requests/minute
- **No credit card required**

## Important Notes

### API Keys Are Optional
- ✅ The system works perfectly without any API keys
- ✅ Yahoo Finance is free and has no rate limits for normal use
- ✅ API keys only provide backup data sources for extra reliability

### When to Use API Keys
- ✅ High-frequency backtesting (many runs per day)
- ✅ Production deployments requiring maximum uptime
- ✅ When Yahoo Finance is occasionally unavailable
- ❌ NOT needed for normal backtesting and development

### Priority Order
The system checks for API keys in this order:
1. Environment variables (highest priority)
2. Streamlit secrets.toml
3. No keys - use Yahoo Finance only (default)

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `/workspace/dual_momentum_system/.streamlit/secrets.toml` - Created with documentation
2. ✅ `/workspace/dual_momentum_system/frontend/pages/strategy_builder.py` - Added graceful error handling

## Testing

Verified that backtesting works:
- ✅ Without secrets file
- ✅ With empty secrets file
- ✅ With documented secrets file (current state)
- ✅ With environment variables
- ✅ With actual backtest execution

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Backtest failures due to missing secrets are now resolved

The system now:
- Works out of the box without any configuration
- Handles missing secrets gracefully
- Provides clear documentation for optional enhancements
- Supports multiple deployment environments
