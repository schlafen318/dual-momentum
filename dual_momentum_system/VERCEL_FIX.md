# 🔧 Fix Vercel 404 Error

## The Problem

**Error**: `404: NOT_FOUND` on Vercel  
**Cause**: You're trying to deploy a **Streamlit Python app** to Vercel, which doesn't support it natively.

## ⚡ Quick Fix (Choose One)

### Option 1: Switch to Streamlit Cloud (EASIEST - 5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Streamlit dashboard"
git push origin main

# 2. Deploy
# Go to: https://share.streamlit.io
# Click: New app
# Select: Your repo → frontend/app.py
# Done! ✅
```

**Your app will be live at**: `https://your-app.streamlit.app`

---

### Option 2: Deploy to Railway (FAST - 3 minutes)

```bash
# Railway auto-deploys from GitHub
# 1. Push to GitHub (same as above)

# 2. Go to railway.app
# 3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub"
# 4. Select your repo
# Done! ✅
```

**Free tier**: $5 credit/month

### Option 3: Keep Vercel (COMPLEX - Requires Rewrite)

⚠️ **Not recommended** - Requires completely rebuilding as Next.js/React

If you insist on Vercel, you need to:

1. **Create a Next.js frontend**
2. **Move Python logic to API routes**
3. **Add vercel.json configuration**

This is complex and time-consuming. Use Options 1 or 2 instead.

## 💡 Why Vercel Doesn't Work

| What Vercel Supports | What You Have |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Static sites (HTML/CSS/JS) | ❌ Streamlit app |
| Next.js/React | ❌ Python backend |
| Serverless functions | ❌ Continuous server needed |

**Vercel** = Static sites + Serverless  
**Your app** = Continuous Python server  
**Result** = 404 error ❌

## 🚀 Deploy Now (Copy-Paste)

```bash
# If you have Git remote already
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push origin main

# Then go to https://share.streamlit.io and deploy!
```

## Still Getting Errors?

**Common issues:**

1. **"Module not found"**
   - Solution: Add missing packages to `requirements.txt`

2. **"App won't start"**
   - Solution: Check `frontend/app.py` is the main file

3. **"Dependencies fail"**
   - Solution: Use compatible versions in `requirements.txt`
