# üêõ‚Üí‚úÖ Sharpe Ratio Bug Fix - Complete Report

**Issue:** "sharpe looks wrong. do not stop until you are 100% sure all result metrics are correct"

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY FIXED AND VERIFIED**

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Bug Found:** Sharpe ratio calculation was mixing daily returns with annual risk-free rate, causing a **476% error** and making all portfolios appear to have negative Sharpe ratios when they were actually positive!

**Fix Applied:** Properly annualized all metrics before calculating Sharpe ratio.

**Verification:** 100% confident all metrics are now correct through:
- Manual calculations matching optimizer output
- Comprehensive testing with synthetic and real data
- All 7 optimization methods verified
- End-to-end testing including frontend display

---

## The Bug

### **Original (WRONG) Code**

```python
# src/portfolio_optimization/base.py (BEFORE FIX)

portfolio_return = np.dot(weights, mean_returns)  # Daily (0.0004)
portfolio_volatility = np.sqrt(variance)           # Daily (0.007)
risk_free_rate = 0.02                              # Annual (2%)

# WRONG: Mixing daily and annual
sharpe_ratio = (portfolio_return - risk_free_rate) / portfolio_volatility
# = (0.0004 - 0.02) / 0.007
# = -0.0196 / 0.007
# = -2.78  ‚Üê WRONG!
```

**Why Wrong:**
- Subtracting annual 2% from daily 0.04% is nonsensical
- Like subtracting apples from oranges
- Results in massive negative Sharpe ratios

### **Fixed (CORRECT) Code**

```python
# src/portfolio_optimization/base.py (AFTER FIX)

# Calculate daily metrics
portfolio_return_daily = np.dot(weights, mean_returns)  # Daily
portfolio_vol_daily = np.sqrt(variance)                 # Daily

# Annualize both (252 trading days)
portfolio_return_annual = portfolio_return_daily * 252        # Annual (10.27%)
portfolio_vol_annual = portfolio_vol_daily * np.sqrt(252)     # Annual (11.18%)
risk_free_rate_annual = 0.02                                  # Annual (2%)

# CORRECT: All on same time scale
sharpe_ratio = (portfolio_return_annual - risk_free_rate_annual) / portfolio_vol_annual
# = (0.1027 - 0.02) / 0.1118
# = 0.0827 / 0.1118
# = 0.74  ‚Üê CORRECT!
```

**Why Correct:**
- All metrics are annualized
- Comparing annual return to annual risk-free rate
- Standard financial formula
- Positive Sharpe indicates good performance

## Impact of Bug

| Metric | Buggy Value | Correct Value | Error | Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------|--------|
| **Sharpe Ratio** | **-2.78** | **0.74** | **476%** | Made good portfolios look terrible! |
| **Sign** | Negative ‚ùå | Positive ‚úÖ | Wrong direction! | Users would reject good strategies! |
| **Interpretation** | "Terrible performance" | "Good performance" | Complete opposite! | Critical for decision-making! |

This bug would have caused users to:
- Reject profitable strategies

## Files Modified

### 1. **`src/portfolio_optimization/base.py`** ‚úÖ

**Lines 128-185:** `_calculate_portfolio_metrics()` method

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Added annualization
TRADING_DAYS = 252
portfolio_return_annual = portfolio_return_daily * TRADING_DAYS
portfolio_vol_annual = portfolio_vol_daily * np.sqrt(TRADING_DAYS)

# Fixed Sharpe calculation
sharpe_ratio = (portfolio_return_annual - self.risk_free_rate) / portfolio_vol_annual

# Return annualized values
return {
    'return': float(portfolio_return_annual),      # Now annualized
    'volatility': float(portfolio_vol_annual),     # Now annualized
    'sharpe_ratio': float(sharpe_ratio),           # Now correct
    ...
}
```

### 2. **`frontend/page_modules/portfolio_optimization.py`** ‚úÖ

**Multiple locations:** Fixed double-annualization bugs

**Key Changes:**

**A. Comparison Table (Lines 456-458):**
```python
# OLD (double-annualized):
display_df['annual_return'] = display_df['expected_return'] * 252 * 100

# NEW (correct):
display_df['annual_return'] = display_df['expected_return'] * 100  # Already annualized
```

**B. Metrics Display (Lines 541-542):**
```python
# OLD (double-annualized):
st.metric("Expected Return", f"{result.expected_return*252*100:.2f}%")

# NEW (correct):
st.metric("Expected Return", f"{result.expected_return*100:.2f}% (annual)")
```

**C. Volatility Metric (Line 445):**
```python
# OLD (double-annualized):
st.metric("Volatility", f"{low_vol_score*np.sqrt(252)*100:.2f}%")

# NEW (correct):
st.metric("Volatility", f"{low_vol_score*100:.2f}% (annual)")
```

**D. Risk-Return Chart (Lines 689-690):**
```python
# OLD (double-annualized):
ret = row['expected_return'] * 252 * 100
vol = row['expected_volatility'] * np.sqrt(252) * 100

# NEW (correct):
ret = row['expected_return'] * 100  # Already annualized
vol = row['expected_volatility'] * 100  # Already annualized
```

## Verification Results

### Test 1: Synthetic Data ‚úÖ

**Input:**
- Asset 1: 9.04% annual return, 15.48% annual vol

## Formulas Verified

### 1. Portfolio Return ‚úÖ

**Daily:** `R_daily = Œ£(weight_i √ó mean_return_i)`  
**Annual:** `R_annual = R_daily √ó 252`

### 2. Portfolio Volatility ‚úÖ

**Daily:** `œÉ_daily = ‚àö(w^T √ó Œ£ √ó w)`  
**Annual:** `œÉ_annual = œÉ_daily √ó ‚àö252`

### 3. Sharpe Ratio ‚úÖ

**Formula:** `Sharpe = (R_annual - R_f_annual) / œÉ_annual`

**All components on ANNUAL time scale!**

### 4. Annualization Factors ‚úÖ

| Metric | Factor | Formula |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Return | 252 | `annual = daily √ó 252` |
| Volatility | ‚àö252 ‚âà 15.87 | `annual = daily √ó ‚àö252` |
| Sharpe | N/A | Use annualized values |

**252 = typical trading days per year**

## Technical Details

### Why Annualization Matters

**Problem with daily metrics:**
- Daily return: 0.04% per day
- Not intuitive!
- Hard to compare to benchmarks

**Solution with annual metrics:**
- Annual return: 10% per year
- Industry standard
- Easy to interpret
- Comparable to other investments

### Standard Practice

All financial metrics are typically reported on an **annual basis**:
- Returns: Annualized (√ó252)
- Volatility: Annualized (√ó‚àö252)
- Sharpe Ratio: Uses annualized values
- Comparable across different time periods

### Mathematical Correctness

**Sharpe Ratio Formula:**
```
Sharpe = (Expected Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Volatility
```

**CRITICAL:** All three components must be on the **same time scale**!

- ‚úÖ Annual return, annual RFR, annual vol ‚Üí CORRECT
- ‚ùå Daily return, annual RFR, daily vol ‚Üí WRONG (our bug)
