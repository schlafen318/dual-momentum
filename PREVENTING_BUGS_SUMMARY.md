# How We Prevent Bugs Like "Sell-Before-Buy"

## The Bug We Fixed

**Issue**: During rebalancing, buy orders failed due to insufficient cash, even though subsequent sell orders would have generated enough cash.

**Impact**: 7.52% unintended cash allocation → reduced strategy returns

**Root Cause**: Trades executed in signal order instead of execution logic order (sells before buys)

## Multi-Layered Defense Strategy

We've implemented **7 layers of defense** to prevent similar bugs:

## What We Created

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite ✅

#### Unit Tests
**File**: `tests/test_rebalancing_execution_order.py`

```python
def test_sell_before_buy_execution_order():
    """
    Tests that sells execute before buys.
    This test would have caught the bug!
    """
    # Run backtest with rotation scenario
    # Verify cash allocation < 1%
    assert cash_pct < 1.0
```

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Execution order logic
- ✅ Cash availability during rotation
- ✅ Full capital deployment
- ✅ Allocation matching target weights

#### Integration Tests
**File**: `tests/test_cash_management_integration.py`

```python
def test_cash_never_goes_negative():
    """Critical invariant: cash >= 0 always."""
    # Run multi-year backtest
    # Check all periods
    assert min(cash_values) >= 0
```

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Cash never negative
- ✅ Portfolio value consistency
- ✅ Transaction costs reasonable
- ✅ No excessive cash drag

### 2. Automated CI/CD Pipeline ✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

Runs automatically on every push/PR:
- ✅ Unit tests (all Python versions)
- ✅ Integration tests
- ✅ Regression tests
- ✅ Code coverage check (>70%)
- ✅ Linting (flake8)
- ✅ Type checking (mypy)
- ✅ Security scanning (bandit, safety)

**Example output**:
```
✓ Unit tests: 42 passed
✓ Integration tests: 12 passed  
✓ Code coverage: 84% (>70%)
✓ All checks passed
```

### 3. Pre-commit Hooks ✅

**File**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

Runs before every `git commit`:
```bash
# Automatically runs:
- Code formatting (black, isort)
- Linting (flake8)
- Critical tests
- Test documentation check
```

**Prevents committing**:
- Broken tests
- Undocumented tests
- Code style violations
- Missing test coverage

### 4. Testing Documentation ✅

**Files Created**:
- `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` - Comprehensive strategy
- `SETUP_TESTING.md` - Setup instructions
- `SELL_BEFORE_BUY_BUG_FIX.md` - Bug documentation

**Purpose**: Ensure team knows:
- How to write tests
- When to write tests
- What to test
- How to run tests

## How Each Layer Would Have Caught the Bug

### ❌ Without Defenses
```python
# Bug committed → deployed → user discovers → 7.52% cash drag
```

### ✅ With Layer 1: Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
$ git commit -m "Update rebalancing logic"
Running test_sell_before_buy_execution_order...
FAILED: Cash allocation 7.52% > 1.0%
❌ Commit aborted

# Developer sees failure immediately, fixes before commit
```

### ✅ With Layer 2: Unit Tests
```bash
$ pytest tests/
test_sell_before_buy_execution_order FAILED
AssertionError: Cash allocation 7.52% exceeds 1.0%

# Bug caught during development
```

### ✅ With Layer 3: Integration Tests
```bash
$ pytest tests/test_cash_management_integration.py
test_no_excessive_cash_drag FAILED
AssertionError: Average cash 7.52% > 1.0% threshold

# Bug caught in realistic scenarios
```

### ✅ With Layer 4: Regression Tests
```bash
# After fixing once:
$ pytest tests/test_rebalancing_execution_order.py
test_regression_sell_before_buy PASSED

# If bug reappears:
test_regression_sell_before_buy FAILED
❌ REGRESSION DETECTED!

# Prevents bugs from coming back
```

### ✅ With Layer 6: Code Review
```python
# PR Review Comment:
# 🚨 This changes execution order. Did you:
# 1. Add tests for sell-before-buy logic?
# 2. Verify cash is never negative?
# 3. Check allocation matches targets?

# Human catches what automation might miss
```

### ✅ With Layer 7: CI/CD
```bash
# GitHub PR Check:
❌ Tests: 1 failed, 41 passed
   test_sell_before_buy_execution_order FAILED
   
🚫 Cannot merge until tests pass

# Prevents broken code from reaching main branch
```

## Example: How to Add a New Test

### 1. Identify what to test
```python
# You're adding a new feature: "max cash reserve"
def set_max_cash_reserve(self, pct):
    """Ensure at least pct% stays in cash."""
    self.max_cash_reserve = pct
```

### 2. Write the test first (TDD)
```python
def test_max_cash_reserve_respected():
    """
    Test that max cash reserve setting is respected.
    
    WHY: Ensures users can intentionally hold cash
    SCENARIO: Set 10% reserve, verify it's maintained
    """
    engine = BacktestEngine(max_cash_reserve=0.10)
    results = engine.run(...)
    
    min_cash = results.positions['cash_pct'].min()
    assert min_cash >= 10.0, f"Cash dropped below reserve: {min_cash}%"
```

### 3. Run test (should fail)
```bash
$ pytest tests/test_new_feature.py -v
FAILED: No attribute 'max_cash_reserve'
```

### 4. Implement feature
```python
class BacktestEngine:
    def __init__(self, max_cash_reserve=0.0):
        self.max_cash_reserve = max_cash_reserve
    
    def _execute_signals(self, ...):
        # Respect reserve
        deployable_cash = self.cash * (1 - self.max_cash_reserve)
        # ... use deployable_cash ...
```

### 5. Run test (should pass)
```bash
$ pytest tests/test_new_feature.py -v
PASSED ✓
```

### 6. Commit
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add max cash reserve feature"
# Pre-commit hooks run...
# Tests run...
# All pass ✓
# Commit succeeds
```
