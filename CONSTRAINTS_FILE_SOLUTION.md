# ✅ FINAL Solution: Pip Constraints File

## The Dependency Hell Problem

**Conflicting requirements that can't be resolved:**

```
numpy==1.26.4 (we want this)
  ↑
  |
pandas==2.2.2 → numpy>=1.21.0 ✓
scipy==1.13.1 → numpy<1.27.0,>=1.19.5 ✓
  ↑
  |
vectorbt==0.26.0 → numba>=0.56,<0.57 ❌
  ↑
  |
numba 0.56.4 → numpy<1.24,>=1.18 ❌ CONFLICT!
```

**The problem:** Even with exact pins in requirements.txt, pip's resolver tries to satisfy vectorbt's loose `numba>=0.56,<0.57` dependency, which pulls in numba 0.56.4, which requires `numpy<1.24`.

## The Official Pip Solution: Constraints Files

### What is a Constraints File?

From pip documentation:
> Constraints files are requirements files that only control which version of a requirement is installed, not whether it is installed at all.

### How It Works

**constraints.txt:**
```txt
numpy==1.26.4
pandas==2.2.2
scipy==1.13.1
numba==0.59.1
llvmlite==0.42.0
```

**Command:**
```bash
pip install -c constraints.txt -r requirements.txt
```

**What happens:**
1. Pip reads requirements.txt normally
2. When vectorbt says "I want numba>=0.56,<0.57"
3. Constraints file says "NO, use numba==0.59.1" ✓
4. Pip installs numba 0.59.1 (compatible with numpy 1.26) ✓
5. No conflicts! ✓

## Files Created/Modified

### NEW: dual_momentum_system/constraints.txt
```txt
# Force specific versions to override loose package dependencies
numpy==1.26.4
pandas==2.2.2
scipy==1.13.1
numba==0.59.1
llvmlite==0.42.0
```

### MODIFIED: .github/workflows/tests.yml
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    pip install -c dual_momentum_system/constraints.txt -r requirements.txt
    #           ↑ constraints flag forces our versions
```

## Why This is Better Than Reordering

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Reorder dependencies** | Simple | Fragile, order-dependent |
| **Use version ranges** | Flexible | Causes conflicts |
| **Constraints file** ✅ | Official solution, robust | Requires extra file |

## Expected Resolution

### Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11:
```bash
Reading constraints: constraints.txt
  numpy==1.26.4 ✓
  numba==0.59.1 ✓
  
Installing from requirements.txt:
  vectorbt==0.26.0
    └─ wants numba>=0.56,<0.57
    └─ CONSTRAINED to numba==0.59.1 ✓
  
Result: ✅ All packages installed successfully
```
