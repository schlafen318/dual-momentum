# Final Analysis: Zero Metrics Issue

## Question: "Why would DateTimeIndex be absent?"

## Answer: **It wasn't absent**

After thorough investigation, the DateTimeIndex was **never missing**. The root cause was a different issue entirely.

## What Actually Happened

### The Real Problem
VectorBT returns **DataFrames** but the metrics calculator expected **Series**:

```python
# VectorBT behavior
portfolio.returns()  → DataFrame (shape: 252, 1)
portfolio.value()    → DataFrame (shape: 252, 1)

# Metrics calculator expected
calculate_all_metrics(returns: Series, equity_curve: Series)
```

### Why This Caused Zeros

When DataFrame was passed instead of Series:
1. **Type checking failed**: `isinstance(returns, pd.Series)` → False
2. **Operations behaved differently**: DataFrame operations don't work the same as Series
3. **Index operations still worked**: `hasattr(returns.index, 'to_period')` → True (even for DataFrame!)

So the DateTimeIndex was present the whole time, but pandas operations on DataFrame vs Series have different behaviors.

## Verification Results

✅ **Input prices**: DateTimeIndex ✓
✅ **VectorBT portfolio**: DateTimeIndex ✓  
✅ **Results.returns**: DateTimeIndex ✓
✅ **Results.equity_curve**: DateTimeIndex ✓
✅ **All metrics**: Calculating correctly ✓

### No Index-Stripping Operations Found
- No `reset_index()` calls
- No `.values` conversions
- No `to_numpy()` calls
- No manual Series creation without index

## The Fix

Simply convert DataFrame to Series after extracting from VectorBT:

```python
# In vectorized_engine.py _extract_results()
equity_curve = portfolio.value()
returns = portfolio.returns()

# Convert DataFrame to Series
if isinstance(returns, pd.DataFrame):
    returns = returns.iloc[:, 0] if returns.shape[1] == 1 else returns.sum(axis=1)

if isinstance(equity_curve, pd.DataFrame):
    equity_curve = equity_curve.iloc[:, 0] if equity_curve.shape[1] == 1 else equity_curve.sum(axis=1)
```

This preserves the DateTimeIndex while ensuring the correct type.

## Current Status

✅ All metrics now display correctly:
- Total Return: -15.26%
- CAGR: -45.72%
- Annualized Return: -34.37%
- Best Month: 4.17%
- Worst Month: -12.17%
- Positive Months: 50%

✅ DateTimeIndex preserved throughout entire pipeline
✅ No fallback logic needed
✅ Clean, maintainable solution
✅ Works for both single and multi-asset portfolios

## Conclusion

The DateTimeIndex was never missing. The issue was a type mismatch (DataFrame vs Series) that caused pandas operations to behave incorrectly. By fixing this at the source, all metrics now calculate correctly without any workarounds or fallback logic.
