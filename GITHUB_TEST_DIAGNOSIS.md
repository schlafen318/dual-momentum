# ✅ GitHub Actions Test Diagnosis

## Current Status

### ✅ Fix Already on GitHub
```
Commit: ab843c2 "Fix: Remove invalid timeout config and suppress pkg_resources warning"
Branch: cursor/integrate-parameter-tuning-into-backtesting-workflow-092f
Status: Pushed to GitHub ✓
```

**The pytest.ini fix IS already on GitHub!**

## Why Tests Might Still Be Failing

Since the `timeout` config error has been fixed and pushed, if tests are STILL failing, it's likely a **different error** now. Here are the possibilities:

### 1. Test Collection Error (Different from timeout)

**Possible causes:**
- Import errors in test files
- Missing dependencies (vectorbt, optuna, etc.)
- Python version incompatibility

**How to check:**
Look at the GitHub Actions log for the actual error message. It won't say "Unknown config option: timeout" anymore.

### 2. Test Execution Failures

**Possible failures:**
- Tests actually running but failing assertions
- Coverage threshold not met (<70%)
- Import errors for specific modules

### 3. Dependency Installation Issues

From the workflow (line 33-36):
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-benchmark hypothesis pytest-mock
```

**Possible issues:**
- Some packages fail to install on Python 3.9
- Conflicting dependency versions
- Missing system dependencies

### 4. Integration Test Failures

The workflow runs these tests separately:
```yaml
pytest tests/test_cash_management_integration.py -v
pytest tests/test_rebalancing_execution_order.py -v
```

These might fail even if unit tests pass.

## What to Check in GitHub Actions Log

### Step 1: Find the Actual Error

Go to: https://github.com/schlafen318/dual-momentum/actions/runs/18745206539/job/53470767419

Look for the **first error** in the log, not the timeout error (that's fixed).

### Step 2: Common New Errors to Look For

#### A. Import Errors
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'VectorizedBacktestEngine'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vectorbt'
```

**Solution**: Check if all dependencies install correctly

#### B. Test Failures
```
FAILED tests/test_vectorized_engine.py::TestVectorizedBacktestEngine::test_...
AssertionError: ...
```

**Solution**: The test logic itself needs fixing

#### C. Coverage Failure
```
FAILED tests/ - coverage report failed under 70%
```

**Solution**: Either increase coverage or lower threshold

#### D. Linting Errors
```
flake8 src/ --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82
```

**Solution**: Fix code style issues

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

Run these locally to catch issues before pushing:

```bash
cd /workspace/dual_momentum_system

# 1. Check if tests collect properly
pytest --collect-only

# 2. Run tests locally
pytest tests/ -v

# 3. Check imports
python -c "from src.backtesting.vectorized_engine import VectorizedBacktestEngine"

# 4. Check coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# 5. Run linting
pip install flake8
flake8 src/ --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
```

## Likely Current Issue

Based on the GitHub Actions run URL you provided, here's what to check:

### Check the Log For:

1. **"Step 6"** mentioned in your URL
   - Line 1 of Step 6 should show what's actually failing
   
2. **Look for these patterns:**
   ```
   ERROR tests/...
   FAILED tests/...
   ImportError: ...
   ModuleNotFoundError: ...
   ```

3. **NOT the timeout error** (that's fixed)

## What I Need to Help Further

To diagnose the actual current issue, please provide:

### Option 1: Share the Error Log
Copy and paste the **actual error message** from the GitHub Actions log (not the whole log, just the error part).

### Option 2: Share Specific Details
Tell me:
- What is the first error shown in the log?
- Which test file is failing?
- What does the error message say?

## Verification Checklist

Confirm the fix is on GitHub:

- [x] Commit ab843c2 exists on GitHub
- [x] Branch is pushed to origin
- [x] pytest.ini no longer has `timeout = 300`
- [ ] Check actual error in latest GitHub Actions run
- [ ] Run tests locally to reproduce issue

## Most Likely Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Dependency Issue (Most Likely)
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement vectorbt>=0.26.0
```

**Solution**: Some packages might not install on Python 3.9. Check if all packages in requirements.txt are compatible.

### Scenario 2: Import Path Issue
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'VectorizedBacktestEngine'
```

**Solution**: Path manipulation in tests might not work in CI environment.

### Scenario 3: Different Error Entirely
The timeout error was just masking another error. Now we see the real issue.

## Next Steps

1. **Check the actual error** in the latest GitHub Actions run
2. **Share that error** with me
3. **I'll provide the specific fix** for that error

The pytest.ini timeout issue is definitely fixed. Now we need to see what the real underlying issue is!

**Quick Action**: 
Go to the GitHub Actions log → Find Step 6 → Copy the error message → Share it here
