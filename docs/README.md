# Documentation Hub

Welcome to the central index for all project documentation. Use this hub to
locate onboarding material, deep-dive references, historical reports, and
troubleshooting archives.

## Start Here

- `getting-started/README.md` - quick-start guides for the broader workspace.
- `dual-momentum-system/README.md` - navigation for the dual momentum
  application and Streamlit UI.

## Core Collections

- `getting-started/` - concise playbooks that bring new contributors up to
  speed quickly.
- `guides/` - how-to instructions and process documentation for recurring
  workflows.
- `reference/` - architectural notes, diagrams, and technical references.
- `troubleshooting/` - diagnostic resources, including a comprehensive fix
  summary library.
- `history/` - status reports and milestone snapshots for audit trails.

## Contributing to the Docs

- Place new documents inside the most relevant collection and update the local
  `README.md` so the material is discoverable.
- Prefer descriptive filenames that capture the topic and, for fixes, add a
  brief outcome summary in the first heading.
- When documenting a remediation, include root cause, the applied fix, and the
  validation steps taken.

If you are unsure where new content belongs, start a draft in `reference/` and
flag it for triage during review.
