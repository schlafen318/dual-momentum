# ✅ Fix Committed and Pushed!

## Commit Details

**Branch**: `cursor/integrate-parameter-tuning-into-backtesting-workflow-092f`

**Changes**: 
- Fixed NumPy 2.0 compatibility by pinning numpy<2.0.0
- Added upper bounds to pandas, scipy, and financial packages
- Resolves `AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found`

## What Happens Next

### GitHub Actions will automatically:

1. **Detect the push** to your branch
2. **Trigger the test workflow** (usually within 30 seconds)
3. **Install dependencies** with NumPy 1.x (not 2.x)
4. **Run all tests** - should pass now!

## How to Monitor

### Option 1: GitHub Actions Tab
Visit: https://github.com/schlafen318/dual-momentum/actions

**Look for:**
- Latest workflow run (just triggered)
- Branch: `cursor/integrate-parameter-tuning-into-backtesting-workflow-092f`
- Status should change from 🟡 In Progress → ✅ Success

### Option 2: Commit Page
Visit: https://github.com/schlafen318/dual-momentum/commits/cursor/integrate-parameter-tuning-into-backtesting-workflow-092f

**Look for:**
- Latest commit with checkmark ✅ or X ❌
- Click the checkmark/X to see detailed test results

### Option 3: Watch for Notifications
- GitHub will email you when tests complete
- Green checkmark ✅ = Success
- Red X ❌ = Still failing (share error with me)

## Expected Timeline

- **0-30 seconds**: Workflow triggers
- **1-2 minutes**: Dependencies install
- **2-5 minutes**: Tests run
- **5-7 minutes**: Complete workflow finishes

## What Should Happen

### Before (with NumPy 2.0):
```
❌ AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found
❌ tests/test_vectorized_engine.py FAILED
Exit code: 1
```

### After (with NumPy 1.x):
```
✅ Installing numpy 1.26.x
✅ tests/test_vectorized_engine.py PASSED
✅ tests/test_hyperparameter_tuner.py PASSED
✅ All tests passed
Exit code: 0
```

## If Tests Still Fail

If you see any failures after ~5-10 minutes:

1. **Click on the failed workflow**
2. **Copy the error message**
3. **Share it here** and I'll fix it immediately

The NumPy issue should be resolved, but if there's another issue hiding behind it, we'll fix that too.

## Summary

✅ **Committed**: NumPy compatibility fix  
✅ **Pushed**: To GitHub branch  
🟡 **Running**: GitHub Actions tests (check in ~5 min)  
⏳ **Waiting**: For test results
